# Node RESTfull API training
I made this project for training REST API with nodejs and express ORM. All the project was made by using VS Code and Postgres Server inside Docker.

## Also in this project:
- Sucrase
- ESlint
- Prettier
- Nodemon
- Sequelize-cli and Sequelize
- bcrypt
- JWT (JsonWebToken)

## Installation and Usage

Do as bellow:

```
yarn

yarn dev

```
It's necessary to create a database and configure it at "config/database.js".
Use the migration to create your database. I'll put a seed someday here.
